Upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2
=======================

This document describes the changes made in symfony 1.2 and what needs
to be done to upgrade your symfony 1.1 project.

WARNING: symfony 1.2 is only compatible with PHP > 5.2.

How to upgrade?
---------------

To upgrade a project:

  * If you don't use a SCM tool, please make a backup of your project.
    As symfony replaces some files during the upgrade
    (front controllers for example), you need a way to merge your
    customizations after the upgrade.

  * Launch the `project:upgrade1.2` task from your project directory
    to perform an automatic upgrade:

        $ ./symfony project:upgrade1.2

    This task can be launched several times without any side effect. Each time
    you upgrade to a new symfony 1.2 beta / RC or the final symfony 1.2, you
    need to launch this task.

The remaining sections explains backward incompatible changes.
