Version 1.1.0 RC1
------------------

* The `sfValidatorPropelChoice` validator doesn't use the ''PHP name'' format anymore to reference table columns, but directly the column name, to be coherent with the way everything else works. Also, the `sfValidatorPropelUnique` validator has been added and is now used by the `propel:build-forms` task.
* Also regarding the forms framework, the possibility has been added to pass HTML attributes for each field when rendering a form or a widget schema, to ease forms templating and output customization. 
* The `plugin:install` task now checks the license of the plugin. If the plugin is not licensed under a LGPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, or PHP license, the task won't install it except if you pass a `--force-license` option.
* Support has been added to the schema YAML format for Propel 1.2 inheritance.
* Paths were incorrect when uploading a file. This has been fixed.
* Tests has been updated to ensure they work under both case-sensitive and unsensitive filesystems.
* Fabian Lange has provided a huge work to ensure the fillin filter works as expected in any case.
* The autoloading performance problem which was occuring in dev environment in certain very rare circumstances has been fixed
