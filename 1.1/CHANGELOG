WARNING: sfI18N class is not a singleton anymore. To use the sfI18N object, you must get it from the context:
         sfContext::getInstance()->getI18N()

         sfRouting class is not a singleton anymore. To use the sfRouting object, you must get it from the context:
         sfContext::getInstance()->getRouting()

         The sfFunctionCache object does not extend sfFileCache anymore. You must now pass a cache object to the constructor.
         The first argument to the call() method must now be a callable (dropped support for "class::method" string).
